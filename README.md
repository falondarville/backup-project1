Project Description:
  We are creating an application that will provide users with a daily video, quote, and suggested action for a certain subject.
  The video watch event and player "checking off" the daily task will give them credit for the day.
  The user will be able to review their progress on a certain task.
  If the user completes the assigned series of tasks they will "level up"
  The user will be given the opportunity to work on another attribute/task they can level up on after the series has concluded.
